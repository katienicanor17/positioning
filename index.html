       <p>
        I am a Year Up student in the Application Developement track. I am dedicated to improving my skills to be a Software Developer. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things. I have been juggling school and work since I was 16. And though I had no idea what my future looked like I was confident that I would find it. Now, that I have, I have the conditioning I need to keep working hard to reach my goals.
